<p>Context</p>
<p>To understand how children represent this epidemic, it is essential to understand how they conceptualize illness. Previous studies suggest that children&rsquo;s conceptualization of illness is complex and their understanding of health problems undergoes important developmental changes as a function of their cognitive skills (1).</p>
<p>By age 5, children picture diseases as germs, faces, or irregular, monster-like shapes. At this age, children are aware of the contagious nature of illnesses such as the common cold (2,3) and report being afraid of getting sick while playing with other children in the playground (4). The concept of contagion is reported in many studies and very early in development (5). However, a study conducted with American children aged 4 to 7 years shows that they imagine germs as non-living beings. They also believe that transmission of disease by germs occurs immediately after contact rather than after an incubation period and that germs grow like tumors but do not reproduce inside the body. On this basis, the authors concluded that children of this age make judgments about the role of germs in illness without considering biological causality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Hergenrather and Rabinowitz&rsquo;s study (4), indicators of illness in children between the ages of 6 and 7 were related to changes in a person&rsquo;s behaviors rather than physical or biological symptoms. Related to this thinking, several studies have shown that young children believe that an illness can be caused by inappropriate thinking or behavior (4,6). However, the belief that misbehavior is the cause or manifestation of illness was rare in this study. By age 9, children understand that a change in internal body condition or the appearance of symptoms may be signs of illness? After age 9, children&rsquo;s representation of illness includes not only the concept of contagion but also infection, internal organ dysfunction (7), and behaviors, attitudes, and feelings. By age 11, children differentiate between the external and internal worlds on a physiological and psychophysiological level. They understand that diseases can be localized in the body but that their causes come from outside the body. Therefore, they consider that the revealing factors of the disease are its physiological symptoms (8). Then, around age 12, children begin to understand that there can be multiple causes of an illness and that the response exhibited by the body can vary depending on the illness (7).</p>
<h2 id="studies-nowadays">Studies nowadays</h2>
<p>More recent studies show that nowadays, Western and Japanese children do not attribute the cause of illnesses that can be explained by germ transmission to deviant behaviors.  For example, in the study by Inagaki and Hatano (2), school-aged children gave more weight to biological causes (inadequate nutrition) than to aggressive behaviors in explaining the causes of illnesses. A more recent study was conducted by Piko and Bak (9) with 128 Hungarian primary school children aged 8-11 years. In this study, the authors wanted to understand how children represented health-related concepts. To do this, they asked the children to answer the following questions: &ldquo;What does health mean to you? What makes you sick? What do you do to stay healthy? What do you do to keep from getting sick? &ldquo;. To answer these questions, the children were asked to draw a picture and answer in writing. Clarification was sought afterwards to allow for better interpretation of the children&rsquo;s graphic responses. The results of this study showed that children mainly described the processes of contagion and contamination to represent the causes of the disease. In answering questions related to the disease, 8-year-olds mentioned air pollution and cat hair. At age 9, the main reasons mentioned were related to smoke, unhealthy food (French fries, spicy food, and hamburgers), and the temperature of food (cold food). At age 10, children mentioned the change of season (the arrival of winter), contagion, pollution in big cities (car exhaust), bacteria that penetrate the body and that white blood cells cannot fight, alcohol, drugs and cigarettes. At age 11, the children mentioned the sudden change in climate, environmental pollution, bacteria and the lack of plants, sports and healthy food, being contaminated by another person, by a dog or by bacteria, forgetting to wash their vegetables or washing their hands. Thus, we can note that a broader understanding of the factors that can cause illness seems to develop between the ages of 9 and 11.</p>
