Until the end of June 2021, we need your help to collect drawings from children aged between 6 and 11 years old, living in Morocco and in France. If you yourself are a parent of children in this age group, or if you know friends or family, you can participate in this study. 
To do so, you will need to ask your children, or those close to you, to take 5 minutes to draw what the pandemic makes them think of. Once this is done, you will have to take two minutes to fill in and send us the following form with a picture of the drawing.

Access the form to fill out: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MAg3nKCiM23vjkYStjOtfujCZ_H5ynRzOFf_yeqIfVk/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1j-g5H0n3bu65RUJaWYIVyK7yWM8AmccqIj5xJT1-9Efy-SzAeKz2ywG0&edit_requested=true

Thank you very much for your help!
